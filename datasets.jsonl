The CAASPP was conducted in 2014, but the 2014 file has a different\nstructure from other years ( it's a \"pp\" file, see below) so it is excluded from this package.\n\n# Download Structure\n\nThe `Base Download` documentation link points to an FTP-like web directory of files, which contain the downloadable\nfiles. The other download pages have links to the files in these directories. These directories, as well as the\ndataset webpages are a bit complex. There seems to be a few different sorts of test result files, but there isn't a\nclear distinction between them. These fiels include:\n\n* \"Paper Based\" results , for 2014 and 2015\n* Tests in Spanish, marked \"STS\" for 2016 and 2017\n* Files with code 'pp'. Some 'pp' files have additional codes 'p2' or 'p3'\n* Files with 'sb', often also with 'p2' or 'p3'\n\nI think 'sb' means 'Smarter-Balanced'. \n\nThe main page for accessing test results, https://caaspp.cde.ca.gov/, has an inconsistent set of links to result\npages for each year. For some years, the links are to \"STS\" results, others are to \"Paper-Based\" and for 2018, the\nlinks are to the \"STS\" and \"Smarter Balanced\" results.\n## Documentation Links\n\n* [CAASPP Homepage](https://caaspp.cde.ca.gov/) \n* [CAASPP Download page, 2015](https://caaspp.cde.ca.gov/sb2017/ResearchFileList?ps=true&lstTestType=B&lstCounty=00&lstCntyNam=Select%20County...&lstTestYear=2015) Dataset page for 2015\n* [CAASPP Download page, 2016](https://caaspp.cde.ca.gov/sb2017/ResearchFileList?ps=true&lstTestType=B&lstCounty=00&lstCntyNam=Select%20County...&lstTestYear=2016) Dataset page for 2016\n* [CAASPP Download page, 2017](https://caaspp.cde.ca.gov/sb2017/ResearchFileList?ps=true&lstTestType=B&lstCounty=00&lstCntyNam=Select%20County...&lstTestYear=2017) Dataset page for 2017\n* [Base Download](http://www3.cde.ca.gov/caasppresearchfiles/) Web directory of downloadable files.\n\n \n \n## Contacts\n\n* **Creator** [California Department  of Education, Assessment Development and Administration Division](mailto:caaspp@cde.ca.gov), [California Department  of Education](https://caaspp.cde.ca.gov/)\n* **Wrangler** [Eric Busboom](mailto:eric@civicknowledge.com), [Civic Knowledge](http://civicknowledge.com)\n \n## Resources\n\n* ** [subgroup_ids](http://library.metatab.org/cde.ca.gov-caaspp-2015e-1/data/subgroup_ids.csv)**.

These files have a few advantages over the oroginal data releases from The California Department of Education:\n\n* Multiple years of records are combined into a single file\n* Files are converted to CSV format to be useful with a wider range of software tools\n* Column names are normalized to be consistent across years\n* Data is presented in a consistent schema, with some erroneous values removed\n\nIf you do not need to analyze multiple years and can work with fixed with text or DBF files, the original, single-year source files may be more appropriate. \n\n** This data is a beta release, and has not been fully verified for fidelity with the upstream source. Use with caution. **\n\nThis file and the attached __schema.csv__ and __documentation.html__ files describe the changes made to the original files in this compilation.

The four\nmeasurements are:\n\n* Coliform, Total      66992\n* Coliform, Fecal      65827\n* Enterococcus         65010\n* E. coli               4428\n\nThere are two units for the measurements: \n\n* MPN/100 mL: \"Most Probable Number\"\n* cfu/100mL: \"Colony forming units\". Number of viable bacteria, excluding the dead ones. \n\nFrom [Cascade Analytical](http://www.cascadeanalytical.com/resources-downloads/faqs):\n\n    What does CFU and MPN mean? A: CFU stands for 'Colony Forming Units' and\n    refers to the number of viable bacterial cells in a sample per unit of\n    volume. For example: 50 CFU/100 mL means 50 Colony Forming Units per 100 mL\n    of sample. It is different from the direct microscopic counts that include\n    both dead and living cells.\n\n    MPN stands for 'Most Probable Number' and refers to a method that uses\n    dilution cultures and a probability calculation to determine the\n    approximate number of viable cells in a given volume of sample. It is\n    useful when samples contain too few organisms for agar plates to be used or\n    when organisms will not grow on agar. For example: 50 MPN/100 mL means that\n    the Most Probable Number of viable cells in 100 mL of sample is 50.\n\nI haven't found traditional data dictionary documentation, [but there are\ncontrolled vocabulary lists](http://ceden.org/CEDEN_checker/Checker/LookUpLists.php) online for data submitters, which explain a lot of\nthe columns.\n\n\n\n## Documentation

Block addresses are the original address of the incident, with the last two digits set to '00'. \n\nBefore geocoding, all of the original block addresses are normalized to be more consistent and to remove different versions of the same address. There are a few transformations performed on the address, including:\n\n  * Converting street types synonyms like 'Avenue', 'Avenu' and 'ave.' to standard abbreviations like 'ave.'\n  * Converting street directions ( 'West main Street' ) to abbreviations like 'W Main st'\n\nMany geocoders are designed to work with mailable addresses, and block addresses are not real postal addresses. This data is geocoded with custom code that uses the SANGIS streets database, matching the block addresses to a street segment. This produces more sensible results, because the crime is attributed to an entire block, rather than to an arbitrary point on the block. However, with the crime is represented as a point, it will appear at the location of the center of the street segment, usually in the middle of the block. \n\nThis means that all of the incidents on a block will appear at a single location. In most GIS programs, it is difficult to see that there are actually many points in one place. Be aware that each point you see may actually be dozens of incidents. \n\nThe files that SANDAG returned included 1,008,524 incident records, and 953,824 records were geocoded (95%). The 'gctype' field has a value of NONE when the  record was not geocoded, and any field that depends on a locations, such as x, y, lon, lat, segment_id, community, and others, will have default values. \n\nCaveats\n=======\n\nAs with most crime data, there are many issues, limitations and problems that users must be aware of to avoid making incorrect conclusions. \n\n*Crime incident data is inherently problematic.* Crime incident reports are collected by busy officers in stressful situations who are trying to describe complex situations with rigid categories. Virtually every point of the data collection process has multiple opportunities for errors and few opportunities for correction after the fact. Analysts must consider the difficulties of collecting crime data when assessing the validity of any conclusions. \n\n*Data is collected by 19 different agencies.* While the data is all sourced from SANDAG, it originates with 19 different police departments. These departments may have different policies that can result in different categorizations for the same crime, and they may have different emphases on  which crimes they pursue. \n\n*Many incidents at a single point.* Because all of the crimes on a block are geocoded to the middle of the block, many incidents will appear as a single point. \n\n*5% of crimes are not geocoded*. GIS users should consider that about 5% of the incidents were not properly geocoded, and are not included in the shapefiles. These crimes appear in the CSV files, and can be included in time series analysis, but they will not be available for spatial analysis. \n\n*Time and dates are often unreliable* Time and dates for many incidents are unreliable, with times being more unreliable than dates. \n\n  * Property crimes that occur while the owner is gone may be recorded as the time a responsible person left the property, arrived at the property to discover the crime, or the average between the two. There is no information available to select among these possibilities, so these incidents have very unreliable times. \n\n  * Because the time is unreliable, so is the date, for crimes that occurred at night. \n\n  * Times may have not been recorded in the original report. These times may be entered as midnight, or as another time. \n\n\n*Multiple crime incidents may not have all crimes recorded.* If a single person is charged with multiple violations for a single arrest, departments may enter only the most serious charge, the last charge, or all of the charges. There is no information to disambiguate these possibilities. \n\n*Locations may be unreliable*. Crimes that involve pursuits or violations committed and multiple locations may be recorded and any of many different locations.  When the location is ambiguous, tt is common for incidents to have the address recorded as the location where the arrested person was charged. Because of this, the highest crime block in San Diego is the downtown police station. Check high crime locations to ensure they are not police stations. \n\n\nDataset Statistics\n==================\n\nNumber of incidents by year:\n\n\tyear        count     \n\t----------  ----------\n\t2007        186014    \n\t2008        178445    \n\t2009        163646    \n\t2010        160133    \n\t2011        147270    \n\t2012        141318    \n\t2013        31699\n\nCrime types, from the \"type\" field, and the number of that type\n\n\ttype                      count     \n\t------------------------  ----------\n\tDRUGS/ALCOHOL VIOLATIONS  230462    \n\tTHEFT/LARCENY             138030    \n\tVEHICLE BREAK-IN/THEFT    123955    \n\tMOTOR VEHICLE THEFT       97498     \n\tBURGLARY                  91695     \n\tVANDALISM                 83912     \n\tASSAULT                   70687     \n\tDUI                       58311     \n\tFRAUD                     55219     \n\tROBBERY                   22685     \n\tSEX CRIMES                22281     \n\tWEAPONS                   11117     \n\tARSON                     2145      \n\tHOMICIDE                  528\n\nIncidents by city:\n\n\tname                       code        count     \n\t-------------------------  ----------  ----------\n\tSan Diego                  SndSAN      401787    \n\tS.D.

Since there are no parcels for roads and other areas, there are two versions of each image. The '-base' version is rasterized directly from the parcels, and has no data over roads and other areas that have an asr_zone of 0.  The '-infill' version fills in cells that have a value of 0 in the '-base' version with the value of the nearest non-zero cell.

The shelter count in this dataset excludes Cal WORKS hotel/ motel\nvouchers and domestic violence shelters for confidentiality reasons.\n\nYouth Count (sample census tracts): Collaborative process with youth\nstakeholders to better understand and identify homeless youth.\n\nDemographic Survey (sample census tracts): Captures the demographic\ncharacteristics of the unsheltered homeless population.\n\nNotes\n\nLAHSA does not recommend aggregating census tract-level data to calculate\nnumbers for other geographic levels. Due to rounding, the census tract-level\ndata may not add up to the total for Los Angeles City Council District,\nSupervisorial District, Service Planning Area, or the Los Angeles Continuum of\nCare.\n\nThe Los Angeles Continuum of Care does not include the Cities of Long Beach,\nGlendale, and Pasadena and will not equal the countywide Homeless Count Total.\n\nStreet Count Data include persons found outside, including persons found living\nin cars, vans, ca mpers/RVs, tents, and makeshift shelters. The conversion\nfactors used to estimate the number of persons found Iivi ng outside are the\nfollowing: For fa milies- Makeshift Shelter = 2.42, Car = 2.96, Van = 2.43, Ca\nmper/RV = 3.35, Tent =

The dataset is compiled from PKIN\nand PKOUT events between the dates of Sept 2018 and Feb 2019 for the whole SaN\nDiego system.\n\nThe dataset is heavily processed to eliminate duplicate events because there\nare many spurious events, but an excess of PKIN events. When computing the\nnumber of cars parked in all parking zones, the excess of PKIN events results\nin about 60,000 extra cars per month. These issues are explored in an [Jupyter\nNotebook](https://github.com/sandiegodata/cityiq/blob/master/notebooks/CityIQ%20\nLeaking%20PKIN%20Events.ipynb)\n\nThe records in this dataset referece parking zones. More information, including geographic positions, are avialble in the [CityIQ Objects dataset.](https://data.sandiegodata.org/dataset/sandiego-gov-cityiq_objects)\n\n## Processing\n\nThese data were produced with these programs: \n\n\t$ pip install cityiq\n\t$ ciq_config -w\n\t$ # Edit .cityiq-config.yaml with client-id and secret\n\t# Scrape PKIN and PKOUT from Sept 2018 to present\n\t$ $ ciq_events -s -e PKIN -e PKOUT -t 20190901\n\t# Split event dump in to event-location csv files\n\t$ ciq_events -S\n\t# Deduplicate and normalize\n\t$ ciq_events -n\n\nThe last step, deduplication and normalization, involves these steps: \n\n* Group events by event type, location and 1 second period and select only 1\n  record from each group \n* Collect runs of a events of one type and select only\n  the first record of the run, up to a run of 4 minutes long \n* For each location, compute the cumulative sum of in and outs ( calculating\n  the number of cars in the zone ) then create a rolling 2-day average.\n  Subtract off the average.\n\nThe third step is demonstrated in this image:\n\n\n![rollnorm](http://ds.civicknowledge.org.s3.amazonaws.com/sandiego.gov/cityiq/rolling-renorm.png \"Rolling Normlization\")\n\nThe blue line is the original utilization for a single location, showing the\nlarger number of PKIN events than PKOUT events. The red line is the 2-day\nrolling average, and the green line is after subtracting the 2-dat rolling\naverage.\n\nIn the final dataset, the data for the blue line is in the  ``cs`` column, which is created from the cumulative sum of the ``delta`` column. The green line is the data in the ``cs_norm`` column, which is differentiated to create the ``delta_norm``column. \n\nFor most purpuses you should use ``cs_norm`` and ``delta_norm``.\n\n\n \n \n## Contacts\n\n* **Wrangler** [Eric Busboom](mailto:eric@civicknowledge.com), [Civic Knowledge](http://civicknowledge.com)\n \n## Resources\n\n* ** [parking_events](http://ds.civicknowledge.org/sandiego.gov/cityiq/cityiq-PKIN_PKOUT-20180901-20190201.csv.zip)**.

It also breaks out\nstation information into a seperate datasets, and enumerates the many\ndifference combinations of methodname/analyte/unit, adding a code for each\ngroup to the dataset in ``measure_code``. The measure code identifies sets of\nrecords that have compatible measurements.\n\nThe dataset adds counts, mean, median and quantiles for groups of\nstation_code/measure_code. The dataset rows are grouped, for each station and\nmeasure code, and mean, median and quantiles computed for each group. The procedure is performed both for ``result`` and for ``lresult``, the log of ``results``. \n\nAfter computing the group summary statistics, the processing creates\ndichotomous features for the relationship of ``result`` and ``lresult`` to the\nsummary value, including:\n\n* Greater than the median\n* Greater than the mean\n* Less than or equal to the 25th percentile\n* Greater than or equal to the 7th percentile\n\nThese variables are particularly useful for doing logistic regressions across the measure code groups or stations. \n\n# Elided Columns\n\nThis datasets excludes the const and empty columns from the source dataset.\nThese columns and their values are:\n\n\n    program                      BeachWatch\n    parentproject                BeachWatch_San Diego County\n    project                      BeachWatch_San Diego County\n    locationcode                 SurfZone\n    collectiondepth              -88\n    unitcollectiondepth          NR\n    sampletypecode               Grab\n    collectionreplicate          1\n    resultsreplicate             1\n    labsampleid                  Not Recorded\n    matrixname                   samplewater\n    mdl                          -88\n    rl                           -88\n    batchverification            NR\n    compliancecode               NR\n    eventcode                    WQ\n    protocolcode                 Not Recorded\n    collectionmethodname         Water_Grab\n    collectiondevicedescription  Not Recorded\n    calibrationdate              0000-00-00\n    positionwatercolumn          Not Recorded\n    preppreservationname         Not Recorded\n    preppreservationdate         0000-00-00 00:00:00\n    digestextractmethod          Not Recorded\n    digestextractdate            0000-00-00\n    analysisdate                 0000-00-00\n    dilutionfactor               -88\n    expectedvalue                0\n    submissioncode               NR\n    county                       San Diego\n    county_fips                  73\n    regional_board               San Diego\n    rb_number                    9\n    sampleid                     Not Recorded\n\nThe dataset also excludes these Null columns:\n\n* observation\n* samplecomments\n* collectioncomments\n* resultscomments\n* batchcomments\n* groupsamples\n* occupationmethod\n* startingbank\n* distancefrombank\n* unitdistancefrombank\n* streamwidth\n* unitstreamwidth\n* stationwaterdepth\n* unitstationwaterdepth\n* hydromod\n* hydromodloc\n* locationdetailwqcomments\n* channelwidth\n* upstreamlength\n* downstreamlength\n* totalreach\n* locationdetailbacomments\n* huc8\n* huc8_number\n* huc10\n* huc10_number\n* huc12\n* huc12_number\n* waterbody_type\n\n\n# Notes\n\n\nThe most prevalent measure code in this dataset is 24 for Enterococcus (analyte) meaured with Enterolert (methodname) in units of MPN/100 mL. This is probably because in 2004, the [EPA changed recomendations to use Enterococcus as a primary indicator bacteria in coastal waters:](https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2004/11/16/04-25303/water-quality-standards-for-coastal-and-great-lakes-recreation-waters)\n\n    EPA subsequently recommended the use of E. coli or enterococci for fresh\n    recreational waters and enterococci for marine recreational waters because\n    levels of these organisms more accurately predict acute gastrointestinal\n    illness than levels of fecal coliforms.\n    \n    \n\n\n\n## Contacts\n\nWrangler\n:   [Eric Busboom](mailto:eric@civicknowledge.com), [Civic Knowledge](http://civicknowledge.com)\n\n\n\n\n---\n\n# Loading the

The source files are:\n\n* Municipal boundaries, of incorporated cities and the rest of the county\n* Communities in unincorporated county areas\n* Communities in San Diego. \n* Census tract boundaries for 2016\n* Census places and counties\n\nIn addition to simply combining these four boundary files, the dataset also\nlinks tracts into the other three regions, in the ``tracts_links`` and\n``tracts_all_regions`` datasets. Using these datasets, you can get all of the\ntracts in Escondido, or all of the tracts in the San Diego community of\nClairemont. The join is performed by containment of the Internal Point, which\nis defined by the census for each tract. Because tract boundaries are not\nalways coincident with municipal boundaries, there are many cases where the\ncollection of tracts for a city or community will have a different boundary\nthan the actual region. Smaller, less densely populated regions, like San\nMarcos, or particuarly afected.\n\nThe ``tracts_links`` dataset is probably the most useful. It joins tracts to\nregions, and has two sets of columns, for city and community. This dataset\nincludes every tract in the county, and each appears only once. If a tract is\nincluded in both a city and community, then there is a name and code for both\nthe city columns and the community columns. Regions not in a city have a city\nvalue of \"County\" and a city code of \"CN\".\n\nThe ``communities`` dataset, has a ``type`` field to distinguish the types of\narea, which is one of:\n\n* city\n* county_community\n* sd_community\n* community\n\nThe ``tracts_all_regions`` dataset may have more than one row for each tract;\nthe tract will appear once for each of the four region types that it is in, but\nno tract is in more than 2 regions. For instance, a tract in a community of San\nDiego will appear twice, once for the community, and once for the City.\n\n\n## Versions\n\n10. Added county outline\n11.

Files are broken into counties, for San Diego and Los Angeles_\n\n\nThe Planing Database is a Census product that combines a range of data from the\nAmerican Community Survey and 2010 Decenial Census into a single file, with one\nrow per census tract. This version of the file includes only tracts in San\nDiego County. The file is linked to ACS format geoids to identify tracts, so it\ncan be easily linked to other tracts data. This data package includes links to\ntwo such files, one for San Diego communities, and one for tract geographics.\n\nThe planning database has about 450 columns. For full definitions of the columns, refer to the [upstream documentation for the source file](https://www.census.gov/research/data/planning_database/2018/docs/2018_Tract_PDB_Documentation_V4.pdf\n). In general, the column names in the documentation must be lowercased for use with the file in this data package. \n\n## Use patterns\n\nIn Python, use metapack to open the data package. \n\n\n\timport metapack as mp\n\tpkg = mp.open_package('http://library.metatab.org/sandiegodata.org-planning-tracts-1.zip')\n\nTo display a simple map, link in the tract boundaries from the communities\ndataset and use the Geopandas .plot() function. The ``column`` argument names\nthe column to use for coloring regions. Note that the column name is copied\nfrom the documentation with mixed case, then lowercased to index the dataset.\n\n\n\ttracts = pkg.reference('communities').geoframe().set_index('geoid').fillna('')\n\tdf = tracts.join(cpdb)\n\t\n\tfig, ax = plt.subplots(1, figsize=(15,10))\n\tdf.plot(ax=ax, column='pct_MLT_U10p_ACS_12_16'.lower())\n\n\nAfter linking in the communities, you can also use the [community id columns](https://data.sandiegodata.org/dataset/sangis-org-communities-2018/resource/668d9a6a-a7a7-4c01-9fb9-a5121c1a622f) to group by city or community: \n\n\n\tseniors = dfg.df.groupby('city_name').pop_65plus_acs_12_16.sum()\n\n# Versions\n\n2. First Release\n3. Clean more currency columns\n8. Extended schema metadata. \n9.

This file is different from the City of San Diego's business list, in that it includes records for the whole county, it categorizes businesses differently ( not using NAICS codes ) and for some categories, it does not appear to be very accurate. \n\nThis package includes two additional files, which link counts of businesses by categories to tracts. \n\n* `tract_counts_rows` presents the counts of businesses as rows. There is one row for each combination of type of business and census tract. \n* `tract_counts_columns` presents the counts of businesses as columns. There is one row per tract, and one column for each type of business. \n\nThe row oriented file is easier to use in tools that have good support for filtering, such as Pandas and Tableau. The column oriented form is easier to use in tools where selecting a column is easier than filtering, such as QGIS. \n\n#\n\nThe  upstream documentation warns:\n\n  Data should be used with caution as not all addresses and/or APN numbers are\n  correct, and certain business sites do not have precise addresses so that\n  locations are approximate. Certain business sites could not be located but\n  remain in the dataset.\n\n## Documentation Links\n\n* [Primary Documentation](http://library.metatab.org/sangis.org-business_sites-1/doc/BUSINESS_SITES.pdf) \n\n \n \n## Contacts\n\n* **Wrangler** [Eric Busboom](mailto:eric@civicknowledge.com), [Civic Knowledge](http://civicknowledge.com)\n \n## Resources\n\n* ** [business_sites](http://library.metatab.org/sangis.org-business_sites-1/data/business_sites.csv)**.
