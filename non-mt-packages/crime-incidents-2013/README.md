ARJIS publishes an extract of the data they collect from San Diego county police departments [to their website at this page](http://www.sandag.org/index.asp?projectid=446&fuseaction=projects.detail). The published file includes only the most recent 180 days of incidents, so we regularly download the files and store them here.
