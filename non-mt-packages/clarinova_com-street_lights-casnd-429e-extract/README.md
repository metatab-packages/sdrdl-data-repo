San Diego Street Lamps
======================

Street lamp locations, derived from SANGIS data. Note that the source file was [last updated](http://rdw.sandag.org/file_store/Miscellaneous/Street_Light.pdf) in June 2008, and there have been a few Street lamp-related projects since then. In particular, most of the lamps in the City of San Diego were converted to Induction in 2013, and there was a project in Kensington to add street lamps in 2012. 

So, this data should be used as a rough-guide to the locations of lamps, rather than definitive data.
